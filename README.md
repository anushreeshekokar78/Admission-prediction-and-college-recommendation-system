🎓 Admission Prediction System

📌 Overview

The Admission Prediction System is a Machine Learning-based application that predicts a student’s chances of admission into a university based on academic and profile-related parameters.

The system uses supervised learning algorithms to analyze factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, SOP strength, LOR strength, and research experience to estimate the probability of admission.


 🚀 Features

* Predicts probability of admission
* Uses regression-based machine learning model
* Data preprocessing and feature scaling included
* User-friendly interface (Streamlit/Web UI)
* Real-time prediction based on user inputs


 📊 Input Parameters

The system takes the following inputs:

* GRE Score
